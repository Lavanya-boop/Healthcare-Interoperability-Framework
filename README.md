# Healthcare Interoperability Framework

A comprehensive project examining health information standards, medical terminology systems, and interoperability solutions for electronic health record (EHR) systems.

## Project Overview

This repository contains work focused on healthcare data standards, medical coding systems, and information exchange frameworks that enable seamless communication between different healthcare systems. Our project demonstrates the implementation of:

- Standard medical terminology systems (SNOMED CT, LOINC, ICD-10, CPT)
- Healthcare system modeling using UML and BPMN
- Data transformation using XSLT for CDA documents
- Interoperability between OpenEMR systems (System A and System B)

## Key Components

### Medical Coding and Terminologies
Analysis of various medical coding systems including:
- ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases)
- SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine -- Clinical Terms)
- LOINC (Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes)
- CPT (Current Procedural Terminology)

### System Modeling
- UML Class Diagrams illustrating patient-centered healthcare system components
- BPMN Diagrams showing clinical workflows for patient management

### Data Exchange Framework
- XSLT stylesheets for transforming CCD/CDA documents
- JSON-based data representation
- Implementation of bidirectional communication between OpenEMR instances

### Use Case Implementation
Demonstration of information exchange for key clinical concepts:
- Medications
- Patient demographics
- Problems/Diagnoses
- Vital signs
